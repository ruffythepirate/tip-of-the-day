# INTRODUCTION

Tip of the day is a simple shell script that prints one random line out of a `~/.tips` file when being called. You can configure this script to be run upon shell startup.

# INSTALLATION

You can either manually copy `totd` (tip of the day) into `~/bin` and then manually `.tips` into `~/.tips` or you can run the included `install.sh`. If you want a tip on bash startup, then add `totd` as an independent line in `.profile`.
