# TERMINAL TIPS
In the bash you can navigate backwards and forwards between words by using `alt+b` or `alt+f`
You can delete the current word in bash by typing `alt+delete` or `ctrl+w`
You can navigate to the start and end of the terminal line by using `ctrl+a` and `ctrl+e`
You can edit you current command in `vi` if you add `set -o vi` to you `.profile` file, and types `esc` while typing a command or by clicking `ctrl-x ctrl-e`
Take an hour and learn vim. Run `vimtutor` in the terminal.
`ctrl+c` kills a process. `ctrl+z` halts a process. Afterwards you can run `fg` (foreground) or `bg` to continue the process in the foreground or the background.
`ctrl+r` lets you search your command history for a previous command.
`history | grep <keyword>` will show you previous commands you've done with a keyword.
